Official repository for the Interspeech2024 paper: 
  - "Speaker- and Text-Independent Estimation of Articulatory Movements and Phoneme Alignments from Speech"
  - https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2024/weise24_interspeech.html

CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
  - Preliminary code
  - Still requires refactoring (will be done after another paper is published)
  - Files are organized into directories solely for better structure, but this arrangement disrupts paths, requiring all files to be in the same directory
  - If you have any questions, reach out!
