Official repository for the Interspeech2024 paper: "Speaker- and Text-Independent Estimation of Articulatory Movements and Phoneme Alignments from Speech" (https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2024/weise24_interspeech.html)

CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
  - Preliminary code
  - Still requires refactoring (will be done after another paper is published)
  - Files are sorted in directories only for organizational purposes (paths are broken this way, required to be all in the same path)
  - If you have any questions, reach out!
